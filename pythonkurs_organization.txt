# Observation:
the output from my program clearly states:
day: wednesday and hour: 16
my conclusion is that most people start work on the assignment or commits directly after the lecture and that the actual work then is more spread during hours and days.
one can also conclude that commits during weekends are rare, as well as after hour 21 and before hour 8.
